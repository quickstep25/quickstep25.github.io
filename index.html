        </h3>

        <p>Hi! I'll tell you a little about myself. My name is Doug Hill and I live in Canton, Georgia.  I've been a web developer for nearly 20 years; I started out as a graphic designer, worked my way into the basics of HTML, then ColdFusion and branched my skills into database administration within the first several years of my career. As most developers know, over the course of time, the skillsets didn't stop there, I am up-to-date on using the latest web programming languages in today's modern technology market.</p>
        <p>I've always been the sort to seek out knowledge, primarily "how things work." I suppose this has played a major role in who I am today because I am always searching for a new skill set to acquire; granted, not always in technology or programming.  I've branched out over the years into acrylic painting as an example, and have come to love it.  Nonetheless, I still enjoy programming just as much as I did when I started.</p>
        <p>Thanks for taking the time to get to know a little bit about me. I hope to collaborate with you soon!</p>

        <p>Before I list out my projects on GitHub, I'll need to mention a few things.  For quite some time now, I have been employed by AT&amp;T.  Which means, all my projects are the property of AT&amp;T, and cannot be shared or used without proper permission.  These projects are privately listed here on GitHub, but in the near future I will be working on public projects in which I can expand my creative ideas on some web development techniques.</p>
